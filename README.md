# Spencer Ferris

I am a game designer and software engineer. I deliver new user-facing features as part of the Alexa on FireTV team using Spring services development and Android app development. I strive to improve the user experience and code/operational quality of all projects I work on. In my free time I mostly play with Godot, Rust, Raspberry Pi, C/C++, and my dog. :)
