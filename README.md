# Spencer Ferris

I am a software engineer and game designer. I deliver new user-facing features at Amazon as part of the Alexa on FireTV
team using Java services development and Android app development. I strive to improve the user experience and
operational quality of all projects I work on. In my free time I enjoy playing with Godot, Rust, Raspberry Pi, C/C++,
and my dog. :)
