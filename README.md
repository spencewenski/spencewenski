# Spencer Ferris

I am a software engineer and game designer. I deliver new user-facing features at Amazon as part of the Alexa on FireTV
team using Spring services development and Android app development. I strive to improve the user experience and
operational quality of all projects I work on. In my free time I mostly play with Godot, Rust, Raspberry Pi, C/C++, and
my dog. :)
